Welcome to the Socorro Zero vagrant development environment and bargain
emporium!

Documentation for using this environment can be found at:

    https://github.com/willkg/socorro-zero

Dev docs for Socorro are at:

    http://socorro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/

If you're starting this vm for the first time, you'll probably want to do this:

    $ cd zero
    $ ./initialize.sh

That'll do all kinds of setup. At the end, you should have a working Socorro in
your dev environment.

If you need help, willkg hangs out on #breakpad on irc.mozilla.org.
